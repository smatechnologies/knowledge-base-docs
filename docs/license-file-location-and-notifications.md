## License File Location and Notifications

**Where To Place A New .LIC File?**

If SAM is installed on the C drive, please copy the license into the SAM directory on your Windows server, this would be `C:\ProgramData\OpConxps\SAM`. This will overwrite the previous file and can be applied at any time during the day, an idle processing window is not required. The new license should take affect within 2 hours of it being copied into the SAM directory.

If SAM is installed on any drive other than the C drive, please copy the license into the SAM directory on your Windows server chosen during the install. This will overwrite the previous file and can be applied at any time during the day, an idle processing window is not required. The new license should take affect within 2 hours of it being copied into the SAM directory. If the license information is not updated after 2 hours please attempt to restart the SMA Service Manager service on the OpCon Server during a quiet time.

If OpCon was installed on a Docker container, the license file will be copied in the volume `../opcon/core/config` corresponding to the internal directory `/app/config` of the container

**License Expiration and Support Availability**

Your license contains two different dates, like in the example below:

* **Expiration**: this is the software expiration date (see part 1, 2 and 3 of this article). After expiration of the grace period, OpCon will no longer be operational until a new license is applied.

* **Product Support**: this is the expiration date of the support. This will not have any impact on OpCon operation.
